In this lab, you will finish your Tic Tac Toe game! Let's add interactivity and make it work :)

Note: You should have already have the game board for Tic Tac Toe from the previous lab.

Requirements
In order for the game to work, you need to write JavaScript that will interact with your HTML elements. 

The requirements for the game are:

Players can click on a cell in order to make a move.
X is always the first player.
After each move, the board is checked for a winner or a draw.
If there is a winner or draw, show a message that announces the winner or declares a draw.
Clicking the board when a game is over should reset the board so that a new game can be played.
